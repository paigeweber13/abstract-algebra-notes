# Abstract Algebra Notes
Notes and summaries created from Abstract Algebra: An Introduction by Thomas W.
Hungerford (ISBN 978-1111569624). I used this book while taking MATH 3163:
Modern Algebra at UNC Charlotte.

Includes notes taken in the Modern Algebra course, but all notes mention what
parts of the book wherein the same material can be found.
